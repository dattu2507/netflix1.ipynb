Complete Netflix data analysis, cleaning and visualization 
Netflix is a popular streaming service that offers a vast catalog of movies, TV shows,
and original contents. This dataset is a cleaned version of the original version which
can be found here. The data consist of contents added to Netflix from 2008 to 2021.
The oldest content is as old as 1925 and the newest as 2021. This dataset will be
cleaned with PostgreSQL and visualized with Tableau. The purpose of this dataset is to
test my data cleaning and visualization skills.
Google paly store apps regulatory affair
While many public datasets (on Kaggle and the like) provide Apple App Store data, there are not many
counterpart datasets available for Google Play Store apps anywhere on the web. On digging deeper, I found
out that the iTunes App Store page deploys a nicely indexed appendix-like structure to allow for simple and
easy web scraping. On the other hand, Google Play Store uses sophisticated modern-day techniques (like
dynamic page load) using JQuery making scraping moreÂ challenging.
